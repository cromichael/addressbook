Overview
----------

The planning of this project is somewhat contrived and is agnostic from any of the
familiar planning tools such as Version 1, et al. The purpose is to show how a project
may be organized to hopefully maintain a predictable velocity.

The Address Book project is managed in the canonical agile way starting with an 
initiative. An initiative is a broad, sweeping goal that may ecapsulate many epics across many teams.

Epics are a more generalized goal that encapsulate user stories with the intent of being measurable. For this project, there are two epics. The [first epic](epic-1/goal.md) is more or less mapped to
the actual work that went on for this project. The [second epic](epic-2/goal.md) is reserved for future enhancements to Address Book.

User stories inform the actual requirements for features customers *think* they want. 
The features in the user stories for the epic 1 were more or less implemented according to requirements.

Requirements are derived from user stories. Actionable concrete tasks can be derived from the requirements.

Oh, and by the way the

Intiative

The initiative of this project is to create a searchable address book.
